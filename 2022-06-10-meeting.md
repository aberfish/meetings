* Working on ROS
    * Time spent: 1 1/2 to 2 day (15 hrs)  
    * Is confident using ROS now
* Started working with rosbag
* Working with Rob on tracking the actual fish robot#
* Not yet tested the fiducial marker on the current camera. Has been working with it on webcam using OpenCV 

# Item 5 - Week Progress - Tom
* Require uppdate from CS Support about PC for ISL
    * Will check progress later today
* Once we recieve PC the plan is to install dependencies and have admin access  

# Item 6- Week Progress - Will
* Tweaked the PID controller on the Tango which should allow the robot to drive smoother
* Worked on Otar's tasks
    * Machine Learning Models 
    * Matplotlib
* Generated two scripts
    1) Visualizing accuracy of training model after each training epoch

    2) Takes complete model and throws it dummy data not seen before and compares with predicted answer - Want to prove that the approah works
