# Item 1 - Week Progress - Bilal
* Monday - Finishing with annotating the fish videos, plotting the trajectories and reorganised everything in the correct file system
* Tuesday - Finishing with annotating the fish videos, plotting the trajectories and reorganised everything in the correct file system
* Wednesday - Focused on the controller, researched more about move_base, made a list of what needed to be done and how to implement, and uploaded python program to git  

# Item 2 - Week Progress - Cloud
* Monday - N/a 
* Tuesday - Morning meeting
* Wednesday - N/a

# Item 3 - Week Progress - Jack
* Monday - Documentation of Translate_coords
* Tuesday - Meeting, Documentation of Translate_coords, learning about transforms and ROS tf/tf2 packages
* Wednesday - Learning about actions in ROS, learning about move_base specifically move_base_msgs package

# Item 4 - Week Progress - Rose
* Monday - Fixing the networking/time sync issues with Tomos
* Tuesday - Morning meeting, then measuring the error in the tango tracker software
* Wednesday - Testing the camera tranform broadcaster code and getting the parameters setup correctly, as well as tuning the dwa local planner params. In the Wednesday meeting demonstrated the full camera coordinate to goal pipeline and tango's obstacle avoidance. In the future the noise in the tracking results could be improved, dwa planner params could be tuned some more to get tango moving smoothly, the bug in the cam to depth coords node which causes the results to need scaling by 0.69 needs working on and the goals sent to move_base could include orientations

# Item 5 - Week Progress - Tom
* Monday - Trying to fix time synchronisation issue between tango and research-pc
* Tuesday - The sd card on tango corrupted, so had to reimage the OS and install the control software
* Wednesday - Present an hour before the meeting to test the path planning and obstacle avoidance

# Item 6 - Week Progress - Will
* Monday - Wrote tango_rtabmap documentation + updated it to the website + minor code tweaks
* Tuesday - Collected, organized and uploaded a public version of wre_tango (a ros package I created for my dis) and a collection of processing scripts to github for potential future work if it leans in the direction of machine learning 
* Wednesday - Attempted to make sure there are no loose ends / get an idea of what I need to do once home + made a start on documenting / tweaking the work uploaded on Tuesday

# AOB:
* Finish version 1 of documentation
* Share documentation with the rest of research group so that future members know how to carry on with the project
