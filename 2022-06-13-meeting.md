# Item 2 - UK-RAS - Bilal + Cloud + Jack + Rose + Tom + Otar + Will
* Robotics conference
* Location: Aberystwyth
* URL: https://www.ukras.org.uk/news-and-events/uk-ras/ukras22-the-5th-uk-robotics-and-autonomous-systems-conference/
* Paper size: A4 (210 mm x 297 mm), double colomn
* Format: Word or LaTeX (We will probably use LaTeX)
    * Work on it in Overleaf
    * Store on GitHub
* Submission of paper: 17:00 GMT Friday 24th June 2022
* Plan is to produce overview of group project and include references
    * Title: 
    * Abstract: 
    * Intro - Background of annotating fish videos, learning by demonstration etc
    * Aims and objectives - Tracking and comparing fish movement to robot movement
    * Hardware and software to achieve results
      * Tango and sensors, overhead camera, software stack + new nodes (novel bit)
      * Emphasis on new software and what it contributes to a scientific community
    * Preliminary results from work so far
    * Conclusion
      * What needs to be done/finished
    * References
      * Learning by demonstration

# Item 3 - Tracking Fiducial Marker - Jack + Rose
* Creating launch file, listing parameters - only source of modification for user
* Publishing ros image of annotated image tracking Tango (useful for headless working)
* No ROS rate (might cause problems communicating with slow(er) ROS nodes
* Now the Fiducial marker can be tracked by the camera we want get the direction the robot is facing
* Get corners of fiducial marker and query depth to determine scale

# Item 4 - Calculate 3D point of camera layer - Jack + Rose
* Get X,Y message from image
* Query depth of pixel from pointcloud (lens and field of view already calculated from camera_info
* Find the URDF model of the camera and create a static transform 3(ish) metres off the ground.

# Item 5 - Tango Mapping Software - Will
* Setup RTAB-MAP on the research PC (not on the robot) to create a map (octomap) using LIDAR scans.
* Create launch file to record all robot and overhead camera topics

# Item 6 - Robot Controller (Data Input) - Bilal + Jack + Rose + Will
* Create dummy image coordinates in csv file - Bilal
  * 3-4 coordinates that the robot should move to so we know it is working correctly
  * CSV format
    * Column 1: x coordinates
    * Column 2: y coordinates
    * Extra: Plot the trajectory of dummy coordinates in separate program using matplotlib 
* Create ROS msg of pixel coordinates
* Listen to input from move_base (robot successfully driven to goal location) - queue next coordinates

# Item 7 - Annotate Fish Videos - Bilal
* Update “Annotate Fish Videos” task on Trello
* Continue manually annotating fish videos for fish 2 1st learning task
* 1 video for each day of the week

# Item 8 - Discord Webhooks - Cloud + Tom
* Setup webhooks and organise into Discord channel(s)
* Add push events to meeting notes
* Add push events to ongoing software repos

# AOB:
* Have a regular meeting during the week such as Wednesday between 14:00-16:00. To discuss and throw around ideas
* The PC will be picked up and dependencies are to be installed on it today (Monday 13th June 2022)
