# Item 2 - Manual Tracking - Claudio Coppola, Jack Thompson
* Have Jack Thompson digitise frames of fish 1 from the video fish1_day1_trial1.mp4
* Claudio Coppola will compare data for fish1_day1_trial1_positions.csv with Jack Thompson's fish1_day1_trial1_positions.csv to identify the difference in distance (pixels) between the fish coordinates selected
* This is to ensure confindence in manual tracking method of the fish so that reviewers know the data is reliable

# Item 3 - Cropping Video Frame + Scaling Fish Coordinates - Claudio Coppola, Jack Thompson, Tomos Fearn
* Create a program that crops a video frame from fish 2 and scales the fish coordinates to be outputted to a new csv file
* These new csv files can then be passed to Rose Brindle who can upload them to the camera and allow the mobile robot to follow fish 2 trajectories
