  * Review 1
    * (weak accept)
    * This paper proposes a control algorithm to be implemented on underwater robots for imitating fish movements. There are a few minor revisions:
    * 1) What are the challenges and limitations of the proposed method?
    * 2) Which type of lidar, is used? 3D or 2D? what is the range of both lidar and camera?
    * 3)  What is the novelty of your work compared to the previous research?
    * 4)  Considering the LbD model, how many number of training is necessary for your work?
    * 5)  Better to add a figure in methodology section B, (a figure that shows the mobile robot, with the onboard sensors)
    * 6) Read the paper carefully and improve the oral language of the paper.
    * 7) Highlight the proposed control algorithm in your paper.
  * Review 2
    * (accept)
    * Good work. Few comments below.
    * Page 1, paragraph 2: the phrase “in this case/paper” is used twice, it isn’t clear whether this is in the case of the work referenced, or the author’s own work. Please reword these such that it is clearer.
    * Page 1, paragraph 2: “However, this methodology was only tested in simulations and may be less accurate once applied to physical robots” this is often called the sim-to-real gap and is an ongoing research challenge. Google Scholar the term for some references.
    * Page 2, paragraph 1: “The ARUCO marker’s used are 5x5 50 markers”, this probably needs more of a description/reference. 5x5 (cm, squares…), and I what does the 50 mean?
    * Page 2, paragraph 5: the description of the error is difficult to follow. Please re-word.
    * V.Conclusion: the paper is missing the context of whether an error of 5cm is acceptable. What is a workable error? And if it needs improving, what are you going to try to improve it?
    * Finally, the paper explicitly says it’s going to address modules 2 and 6 of the list of modules presented. Please refer back to these in your conclusion/discussion and state whether you have addressed them.
