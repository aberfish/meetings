# Meeting 1 - 2022-06-01

# Present:

* Bilal
* Jack
* Rose
* Tom
* Will

# Absent:

* Cloud

# Item 1 - Install dependencies on camera PC - Tom

* Get the PC from CS-support
* Ensure Admin access to Linux partition
* Install ROS (Noetic)
* Install camera drivers
* Install Tango dependencies - https://github.com/fearn-robotics/ 
* Setup bash profile for robot network
* Setup remote access (ssh)
* (Install ROS on aberforward PCs) - All
* Install Anaconda (virtual Python env) - All

# Item 2 - Tracking robot with camera - Jack and Rose
* Sample data from depth camera in ISL
* Choice of:
  * Fiducial Markers (will need to be researched)
  * Coloured marker (bright color)

# Item 3 - Setup code repositories for development (https://github.com/aberfish) - Cloud + Tom
* Setup Github organization
* Setup Github teams on groups and repositories 
* Add members
* Sort out permissions
* Tango repositories will remain at https://github.com/fearn-robotics as master branch
  * Add permissions for Will

# Item 4 - Fish Trajectory - Bilal
* How many videos have been manually annotated so far?
* Continue with manual annotation of fish videos

# Item 5 - Camera Pipeline - Jack and Rose
* ROS nodes in charge of individual parts of pipeline (refer to whiteboard diagram)
* Input x,y coordinate of image - publish to topic
* Query distance of x,y coordinate from depth camera (sensor_msgs::pointcloud2) (work out the scale of the env)
* Translate pointcloud2 coordinates to map coordinates geometry_msgs::stampedTransform
* Publish transform to move_base and path planning

# Item 6 - Robot Controller (Data input) - Bilal + Will
* Dummy image coordinates ROS node to publish to first stage of camera pipeline
  * 3-4 coordinates that the robot should move to so we know it is working correctly
  * Contained in a csv file
    * Two columns: x, y 
* ROS node to publish csv of image coordinates - wait for ROS robot confirmation on successful goal completion

# Item 7 - Future goals
* Provisional plan will not be met in under 8 weeks. We want to get the basics sorted. Once that is complete then we can move onto the next stage
* Need to make manageable predictions on end results
* Next group will take over this project, we don't know who at this time. Make sure we have documentation in place so people can take over without having too many problems - All
